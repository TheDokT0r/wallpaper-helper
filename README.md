# wallpaper-helper
## The What
This is a small python program that converts webp files to jpeg so they can be displayed as a wallpaper

## The Why
I've recently reinstalled GNU/Linux, and I looked on the web for some cool wallpapers for my dekstop. To my horror, a big chunk of the images online were in the infamous webp format, that's not supported for wallpapers on KDE. I was way too lazy to use an online converter, so I've made my own... Enjoy!
